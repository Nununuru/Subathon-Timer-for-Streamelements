### Command Settings
- `Command Word (case insensitive)`: Which word to use for commands (default: `!timer`). You do not need any special chars in the beginning, but it is recommended.
- `Additionally enable commands for mods`: Disable this if you do not want your mods to be able to use the commands (in that case only the streamer can use them).

#### How to
Start each command with the command word you set followed by the argument (`!timer <argument>`). Here are all possible arguments:
- `start/continue`: Start/continue the timer with whatever time is visible now.
- `stop`: Stops/Pauses timer (time can be still added with follows/subs/etc).
- `reset`: Reset value of the timer to start value
- `add <time>`: Add time to timer. Examples:
    1. `!timer add 232`: Adds 232 seconds.
    2. `!timer add 22:11:13`: Adds 22 hours, 11 minutes, and 13 seconds.
    3. `!timer add 2:-30:-12` Adds 2 hours and substracts 30 minutes and 12 seconds.
- `set <time>`: Set the timer to a specific time. As a format use `hh:mm:ss`. 

### Happy Hour Settings
- `Command Word (case insensitive)`: Command word to use for triggering happy hour (default: `happy`).
- `Happy Hour Multiplier`: With how much the added time will be multiplied during happy hours.
- `Happy Hour Duration (in hours)`: With how much the added time will be multiplied during happy hours.
#### How to
To start and cancel happy hours you need to use the command word specified for happy hours followed by the argument (`!happy <argument>`). Here are all available options:
- `start <type>`: Start happy hour with a specific type (`follows`, `subs`, `tips`, `cheers`/`bits` and  `raids`). If started all events of the type that was specified will be multiplied with the multiplier from the settings. You can only start ONE happy hour for one type at a time. Starting another will override the last one. <br>Example:
```
!happy start follows // Will start happy hour for follows

!happy start bits // Will overwrite current happy hour & restarts duration

!happy cancel // Will cancel currently active happy hour
```
- `cancel`: Cancel currently active happy hour.

## Q&A
### Can I use Subatimer with other services (e.g. tipeeestream, streamlabs, etc.)?
This timer only works in StreamElements. However, since everything except donations comes from Twitch (follows, subs, cheers) you could use StreamElements and this widget additionally to whichever service you are using. Keep in mind that your mods (or you) have to add donations manually to the timer in that case.
### Can I disable the shadow (or border)?
There is no direct setting to disable the shadow (or border). However, you can hide them by editing the color and using the transparency control and make the element fully transparent. This will basically hide it.
For the border yo could also just turn the width to 0.
